## About

Open 777 is a small online website for easily looking up Crowley's Esoteric Kabbalistic / Qabalistic correspondences, meant for Esoteric Study & Practice.

The website consists of transcriptions done by [ADAM BLVCK](https://adamblvck.com) from the now in open-domain book "777" by Aleister Crowley (with the help of Occultish Angel (see IG), and Frater Conditor Nubium from [Liber Oz](https://liberoz.org/)). Attributions into Sight, Hearing, Smell & Taste, Astral and Causal have been provided and credited by Jason Louv (@magickme) from [Magick Me](magick.me).

This digital reference tool is designed to make Aleister Crowley's system of correspondences more accessible and interactive, serving as a bridge between traditional occult knowledge and contemporary technological convenience. The primary source, "Liber 777" (published in 1909), is a fundamental text in Western esoteric traditions that contains detailed tables of correspondences between various magical and mystical traditions, including Kabbalah, Tarot, astrology, numerology, and more.

The application offers two main ways to explore these correspondences:
- A traditional table view using [Glide Data Grid](https://github.com/glideapps/glide-data-grid)
- An innovative card-based interface perfect for mobile usage

You can filter information by categories such as Spheres, Planets, Zodiacs, Elements, and Paths, making it easier to focus on specific aspects of the system. Each entry is carefully preserved from the original source while being presented in a format that's more accessible to modern practitioners.

If you're looking for a way to look-up Gene Keys and IChing-based correspondences, I refer to [Gnomon](https://gnomon.adamblvck.com/).

Since 777 includes correspondences from the Kabbalistic Scale to the 64 hexagram, and the Gene Keys include correspondences to Tarot's 22 pathways, a marriage between both systems might result one day.

## The Website

In the books, the tables of correspondences is organized in 32 rows which represent the Kabbalistic scale of meaning, which spans many pages of correspondence categories. In the app a transposed approach is used, where the 32 "steps" on the scale are presented as columns, whereas the rows indicate categories.

The website uses [Glide Data Grid](https://github.com/glideapps/glide-data-grid) which is most suitable for this purpose, and includes search-functionality across the whole table.

**Update 2025: a new card-view update has been added, for better immersion and searching through the library. It's also mobile friendly now!**

## The Data

The to-transcribe data is huge, and thus this website will be updated every few days until all correspondences are covered. If you think you can help with transcription, please message me here or at contact@adamblvck.com.

The correspondence dataset can be found as a json object in the file `src/liber_777.js`, or `docs/liber_777.csv`, but the source of both these files is now hosted on [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bJPN_gs6USHniUfmWFIACCroOAzOq8jX2XWITclSBA0/edit?usp=sharing). The python notebook located at `docs/convert_json.ipynb` can be used to convert a csv (exported from the Google Sheet) into an appropriate format for use in a website, or javascript environment.

A recent contribution by an anonymous frater completed almost all columns from Liber 777.

**Please note, that this app capture's Aleister Crowley's Correspondences, not all other correspondences from the many esotericists out there. The idea to capture many magicinan's correspondences in a beautiful correspondence platform is a truly blessed idea.**

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

Ensure that you've setup github pages by isntalling it, then configure package.json properly, to ensure that the `homepage` points to the correct destination:

```
npm install -g gh-pages --save-dev
```

Then publish through, which will go through an react-app build process, after which the app will be deployed:

```
npm run deploy
```

The command above will build an optimized Standalone React Build, then commit this data the gh-pages branch. In GitHub this deployment can then be selected in Settings>Pages, allowing for free gitHub pages deployment.
