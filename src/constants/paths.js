    "name": "State Of Union That Controls Consciousness",
    "description": "The thirteenth path is the unifying intelligence, so called because it is itself the essence of glory. It is the perfection of the truth of individual spiritual beings.\n\nThis path is the essence of 'Glory'. It represents the achievement of true essence by united spirit beings.\n\nThe Thirteenth Path, as Gimel, has been called “the dark night of the soul”. The reason is that this thirteenth path crosses the abyss leading directly to Kether. The letters Gimel means 'camel'. And it symbolizes a medium that crosses the seemingly infinite abyss desert alone. Gimel is the ultimate source of water and expresses the primordial essence of consciousness. The letter Gimel has the number 73 when spelled out. It is also the coefficient of the second Sephirah, Chokmah (Wisdom). Throughout the Old Testament, wisdom is used as a female name, Sophia. Sophia, or the World Soul, is an intermediary between God and man and has been called the \"Soul of Light.\" The reason is because the light of the soul is the first medium that covers itself.\n\nTogether with Temperance and the Universe, these paths constitute the middle pillar in the tree of life. The path of Tau (Universe) is called \"The Door to the Inner Plane\". And both Samekh (temperance) and Gimel (high priestess) have been called \"the dark night of the soul.\" The reason is that both cross an abyss. Even though Samekh is down on the tree of life, Samekh (temperance) still crosses the \"lesser\" abyss on his journey to Tiphareth. On the direct path to Kether, the spiritual seeker often experiences loneliness, solitude, futility, and fear. In the process, spiritual seekers faithfully advance towards an imperceptible and imperceptible endless goal.\n\nWalking the thirteenth path unites the human incarnation with the eternal self, and when safely crossing the abyss, the greatest initiation is bestowed. This path teaches a lot about the harmony of opposites. The reason is that the intelligence of unity or unity evokes us to see beyond our common duality. Interestingly, in Hebrew the word “unity” also equals thirteen. That is, the number of the High Priestess' Path. When the work of this path is completed, the One, which expresses itself in numerous forms, is directly experienced as a theology.\n\nThe Thirteenth Path connects Tiphareth (the divine incarnation) with Kether, the highest source, and the High Priestess, whose location is in the middle of the two pillars, refers to the middle path. In Qabalah, the High Priestess, known as the \"Unified Mind,\" unites the personality or ego consciousness with the higher self. It is this intelligence that gives the realization that all things are united by the Divine Mind. This path is considered to be the spiritual bride and mother and the gateway to the third law, the reward of the slain and resurrected person."

    "description": "The Twenty-first Path is the Intelligence of Reconciliation, so called because it receives the influence of God flowing into it from the blessings bestowed on all beings and each being.\n\nThis path is the state of receiving the influx of divinity, through which all beings receive the blessings of the gods.\n\nThe 21st path connects between Netzach and Chesed, and directly reflects the power of Jupiter, meaning benevolent king. The alphabetic attribute is the letter Kaph, which in its general form represents a cupped hand for receptivity. In its final form, this character represents a hand with fingers spread out for release. This symbol system corresponds to the ascending and descending aspects of the alternative to the wheel of fortune. The letter Kaph, when spelled, means the palm as well as \"closed and clenched hands\" and has the numeric value 100. These numerical values ​​equate to “Exercise” and “Effort” (MDVN), and Kaph's path involves considerable exertion and exertion and requires keen discernment in determining what is spiritual and what is beneficial to one's soul.\n\nKaph is layered with mystical meanings and is closely linked to prophecy and vision (ChZH). This is evidenced by the fact that they have the same numerical value, 20. Interestingly, Christian Rosencreutz, founder of the Order of the Rosicrucians, was often referred to as “Brother Kaph.”\n\nThis path is called the “reciprocating intelligence of those who seek” or “the reconciling intelligence.” This means that the wheel acts as a mediator between the opposite poles of Personality and Higher Self. This path connects Chesed, or Divine Mercy, with the nature of desire, or Netzach. In the process of evolution, this means that Hesd's Divine Mercy descends into matter driven by Neza's desires. The implication of this path is that after an unsatisfied hunger, the soul's undefined aspirations are only stirred up and transformed into something higher by the fainter memories (hesd) of richer experiences found in the inner life. .\n\nFundamental to the mysticism of this key is the cyclical nature of life, as it expresses the regularity of the seasons, the repetitive actions of mankind and astronomical movements in the sky. These cycles of life and nature follow certain laws, and man is subject to these certain laws until he attains mastery (symbolized by Beth, the sorcerer). The law in the Wheel of Fortune is expressed by TORA, which is the Body of Wisdom and the Law in the Jewish Scriptures. Reading TORA in a different way, ROTA is inferred, which is Latin for wheel, and TAROT embodies the archetypal image of the wheel of life. The wheel is a symbolic synthesis of all cosmic forces as well as the passage of time.\n\nKabbalah teaches that the secret to mastering the environment is to be found through enlightenment, and that the center, the heart of the wheel, or the initial base of oneness, is our only resting place. When we identify with the dominion that balances the rotating activity of the cosmic cycles, we are at the beginning and end of our quest in the same time. The reason is that these (start and end) are actually the same place."

    "title": "Path 23",
    "name": "The State Of Sustaining",
    "description": "The Twenty-Third Path is the Stable Intelligence, so called because it possesses the virtue of unity in all ranks.\n\nThis path is the power that sustains all Sephiroth. The 23rd Path, which runs between Hod and Geburah, is governed by the water element. The Hebrew letter Mem means \"waters,\" or sea. Water is considered the first principle in alchemy, which underlies everything else. Water is the most stable and more fundamental of the elements. Between brilliance and power, the gloom and ripples and lamentation of great waters are here. However, this concept of water as an element cannot be completely overshadowed by Saturn's Binah. The aspects of Pisces, Cancer and Scorpio must all exist in the water trinity. (We will also see the fire trinity on the 31st path.) Therefore, we have here the disinterestedness of Pisces, the maternal quality of Cancer, and the radiance and reflected fire of Scorpio. It reflects the adaptability, brilliance, and endurance of water to conquer. The image of the Hanged Man depicts this stable intelligence because he cannot separate it from the Unity that water expresses and is deeply immersed in cosmic consciousness. The most implicit symbolic system is the symbolic system of reversal or suspension of general consciousness and general activities, and symbolizes immersion in superconsciousness. This key expresses the cessation and absolute surrender of the individual will. The mythological concept of sacrifice, the power of a dying god, is cosmic and cross-cultural. The Norse god\n\nOdin\n\nwas hung on the world tree for nine days, and Dumuzi in Sumer, Osiris in Egypt\n\n,\n\nAttis in Phrygia,\n\nAdonis\n\nin Syria,\n\nMithra\n\nin Rome and\n\nDionysus\n\nin Greece were all sacrificed and resurrected as gods. The main image of a dying god is that of complete liberation, restoring the Creator back to the throne, and losing the false personal self in search of the Eternal Self."

    "name": "The State Of Being Born Again",
    "description": "The twenty-sixth path is called the Renovating Intelligence, because the Holy God (Praise the Lord) by it renews all the changing things that are renewed by the creation of the world.\n\nIt means that the 'Blessed Holy One' renews all things embodied through creation.\n\nThe 26th Path is called the “Resurrecting Intelligence” because “God, the Holy One, resurrects with this Resurrecting Intelligence all the changing things that are resurrected by the creation of the world”. This suggests one of the great mysteries. Ayin is said to harbor many mysteries, and Gematria's association with Ayin equals 70 for both the letter Ayin and the word for \"secret\" (SVD). The Ayin, or eye, is the organ of vision and sees the exterior and appearance of things, and no further penetration is possible.\n\nThrough the function of the eye we perceive cosmic phenomena, what the East calls Maya, illusion, deception. In Qabalah, the world of appearances is not itself a world of deception, but an illusion arising from our own perception. At Ayin, we learn to use the intelligent eyes of Hod to see anew in the light of beauty illuminated by Tiphareth. Ascension on this path is the process of transferring consciousness from the concrete mind to the abstract mind, that is, from the ego to the Higher Self.\n\nThe path between brilliance and beauty can be thought of as an ecstatic experience. But, in fact, this path is influenced by the cold and earthy nature of Capricorn, the earth sign of Saturn. Knowledge and calculation are here. And it has the material side of things that can be harmful if developed without love. If we must recall that in its qliphothic (excessive or unbalanced) aspect, Hod becomes the realm of Samael, the devil in the Garden of Eden, that the temptation offered was merely a way to attain knowledge. should know"

    "title": "Path 29",
    "name": "Material State Of Consciousness",
    "description": "The twenty-ninth path is the bodily intelligence, so called because it gives form to all the worlds and all bodies formed under their multiplication.\n\nThis path describes the development of the materialized according to the systems of each domain.\n\nThe 29th route is another route that threatens the traveler with the risk of disintegration. That is, since this path leads to Netzach, it can cause mental disruption. What is indicated here is the renunciation of individuality. The journey from Malkuth to Netzach is a confluence of physical and emotional natures. With that comes a powerful emotional complexity, the balance here is to use \"reason\" when called upon.\n\nA “shadow” often appears on this path. Just as Path 31 needs to be balanced with instinct and emotion, Path 29 needs to be balanced with intellect and reason. This 29th path, the path of outflow and reflow, the journey of evolution, can be experienced as a \"mental conception\", just as we experience birth through the vibrating Netzach, the Awoken. All paths leading towards Netzach are Orphic paths. It is similar to Orpheus, the mystic poet who enchanted nature with the gift of song.\n\nAt the back of the head is the medulla oblongata, which is referred to by esoteric tradition as a link between the upper brain centers and the spinal column and the lower centers of the body. The medulla governs respiration, heart movement, circulatory system, and all forms of health maintenance, and performs those functions even while we sleep. Interestingly, the activity assigned to Qoph is a function of sleep. The value of the letter q is 100 or 10x10 (i.e. the number of sephiroth multiplied by itself) as well as the value of the word Kaleem, i.e. coffin or utensil. And it brings us a clear meaning of the relationship of the sacred through the medium of expression, the instrument of the body and its bodily intelligences.\n\nCalled physical intelligence, this is truly the pathway to body consciousness. One of the most important lessons of this path, emphasized repeatedly in the Qabalah, is that it is not to our advantage to try to separate the \"higher state of mind\" from the \"lower coarse\" form of the body. If we ignore the body, we ignore the soul embodied in flesh. The Aspirant's purpose is to begin where nature forbids and proceed to complete the Work of Evolution. This is very similar to how alchemists worked with matter. The image of growth is indicated by the word Qoph, which when spelled equals 186 and has the same value as the word mosaph, meaning “to improve.”"

    "description": "The Thirtieth Path is the Gathering Intelligence, so called because the astrologers infer from it the judgments of the stars and celestial signs, and the perfection of their learning, according to the laws of their revolutions.\n\nThrough this path, \"the one who spreads the heavens\" increases his control over the stars and constellations while establishing the knowledge of the chariot wheels in each realm as a theory.\n\nThis 30th route runs between Yesod and Hod. This path leads from the realm of the moon to the realm of reason, and although it is gloomy and cold, it is the coolness of the creative imagination by the power of the intellect. However, the full power of the sun shines there. “Brilliance” is suitable for both the Sun and Sephirah Hod. The Hebrew letter assigned to this path is Resh, meaning “head,” and the spelling of Resh equals 510, or 15. Hod is spelled (HVD) and also has a numeric value of 15. The ultimate sum of each of these words is 6. That is, 6 is the number of Tiphareth, whose image of the king is very strong on this path.\n\nResh has a value of 200 and also translates as “awakening” with the numerical value of “that which belongs to the spring,” a magical childlike ritual. This pathworking begins with Yesod, who rules the moon and imagination, and ends its fate in Hod. The Horde is a realm of pure knowledge and esoteric inspiration.\n\nThis path is the path of great discovery because it leads to the field of activity of the mind. It is often described as a point of profound encounter with the inner master. This path is also a balance between mind and body. It stands out at the heart of the relationship between intellect and intuition. In particular, this path is a process by which most people can begin to grow “backward” with recollection of the source from which we emerged.\n\nResh's path is devoted to the refinement of the physical senses for the purpose of better regeneration of the personality. As mentioned earlier, Resh means “head” or “complexion”, and it is in the human head that the dominant factor of life is located at the center. The dominant element of our solar system is the sun, and the sun has a radiant complexion. Therefore, human consciousness is the form in which life force is completed. This is called the collective intelligence because this pathway synthesizes and adapts all other forms of consciousness while governing the laws that govern reality.\n\nOn this path, the spiritual seeker attempts to develop a vision, a practice that removes mental, emotional, and physical hindrances in order to create a profound inner regeneration. This is indeed the path through which the active work of alchemy takes place. Astrological references to this point to Hod, the planet Mercury, and the divine form Mercury or Hermes. Hermes is the god who presided over all alchemical activities. The sun represents the goal of the great work in the regenerated sun stone."
